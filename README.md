# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Sample Application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

##Highly recommended!

This tutorial is awesome! It's like sitting beside a veteran programmer and
having him explain the *reason* why you're doing what you're doing.

Try coding the whole thing by hand, don't copy and paste!  It takes longer,
but you build your coding muscle memory!
